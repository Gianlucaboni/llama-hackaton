# README: ChefChatBot with LangGraph Agent and Groq-powered LLAMA Model

## Overview

**ChefChatBot** is an intelligent conversational agent that uses advanced AI to assist users with dietary needs, recipe generation, and nutritional information. Powered by **Groq's LLAMA Model** (`llama3-groq-70b-8192-tool-use-preview`), the bot leverages **LangGraph**, a flexible framework for orchestrating multi-tool conversational agents, enabling dynamic interactions through various tools and memory capabilities.

## Features

1. **Groq's LLAMA Model**:
   - High-performance natural language understanding and generation.
   - Supports tool integration for diverse tasks.

2. **LangGraph Framework**:
   - Implements a **StateGraph** for stateful conversations.
   - Allows modular addition of tools and flexible routing based on user input.

3. **Integrated Tools**:
   - **Food Info**: Provides nutritional information about ingredients.
   - **Diet Explorer**: Helps explore diets based on preferences and constraints.
   - **Quantity Optimizer**: Suggests optimized quantities for recipes.
   - **Retrieve Recipes**: Fetches recipes from external sources or databases.
   - **Recipe Generator**: Creates customized recipes based on user input.

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Uses `MemorySaver` for storing session data.
   - Supports long-term stateful interactions with users.

5. **Streamlit User Interface**:
   - Interactive UI for real-time conversation and visualization of tool responses.
   - Supports user input, tool-based suggestions, and feedback loops.

## How It Works

### Architecture

The core logic is built around a **StateGraph** that defines the flow of messages and tool invocations. The bot processes user inputs, invokes necessary tools, and routes the response back to the user, ensuring conversational coherence.

1. **Session Initialization**:
   - Initializes conversation history, memory saver, and tools in the Streamlit session state.

2. **Graph Definition**:
   - Nodes represent the chatbot logic and tool invocations.
   - Conditional edges handle routing based on AI-generated `tool_calls`.

3. **Tool Integration**:
   - Each tool is wrapped as a node in the graph, ensuring modularity and reusability.

4. **Conversation Handling**:
   - Captures user input as `HumanMessage`.
   - Processes the conversation state using the compiled graph and tools.
   - Outputs responses as `AIMessage` or `ToolMessage`.

5. **Feedback and Verification**:
   - Prompts users to verify recipe suggestions.
   - Saves approved recipes to a personal diary for future reference.
